# Tic Tac Toe
Classic game vs unbeatable AI

This is the classic game of tictactoe, played against an unbeatable AI--it will either win or draw the game. The AI uses a minimax function to recursively analyze all possible moves and end-game scenarios to determine the best move. It also continues to make optimal plays even when it cannot win.
